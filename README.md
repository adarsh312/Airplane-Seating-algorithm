# Airplane-Seating-algorithm
A Java program to allocate seats for passengers based on given conditions.

Conditions to be followed while allocating seats using java:

• Always seat passengers starting from the front row to back,
starting from the left to the right
• Fill aisle seats first followed by window seats followed by center
seats (any order in center seats)

INPUT FORMAT:

• a 2D array that represents the rows and columns [ [R,C], [R,C],
[R,C], [R,C] ]
• Number of passengers waiting in queue.

Below are the points to be noted:

1.The Logic / Data structure / Algorithm used to successfully complete the programming challenge
2.The elegance of the code, modularity and readability
3.A VISUAL output that is printed (on the screen, in a console or exported to a file etc.) in way that is easy to read, identify the aisle, middle and window rows and has clear seating plan and passenger number.
4.Testability, TDD and test cases

Software requirements:
 
since we are using java for coding ,needed jdk 
-check for latest version:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html
 
 NetBeans-platform to execute code.
 various verion available.
