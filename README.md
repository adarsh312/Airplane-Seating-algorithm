# Airplane-Seating-algorithm
A Java program to arrange the seating for the Airline Passengers

A program that helps to allocate seats to the passengers in a flight based on the following input and rules.

• Always seat passengers starting from the front row to back,
starting from the left to the right                                                    
• Fill aisle seats first followed by window seats followed by center
seats (any order in center seats)

INPUT FORMAT:

• Input to the program will be:

• a 2D array that represents the rows and columns [[3,4], [4,5], [2,3], [3,4]]. This 2D array is just an example. The input to the program will be a dynamic 2D array. 

• Number of passengers waiting in queue.

See below for an example input and the respective seating arrangement based on the input.

A 2D array that represents the rows and columns [[3,2], [4,3], [2,3], [3,4]]

 if 2D array represents the rows and columns,further steps needs to be processed before allocating seats (i.e Array should be preprocessed) .


OUTPUT:
 A visual output understandable,check it out:output.txt that i added.

Below are the points to be noted:

1.The Logic / Data structure / Algorithm used to successfully complete the programming challenge
2.The elegance of the code, modularity and readability
3.A VISUAL output that is printed (on the screen, in a console or exported to a file etc.) in way that is easy to read, identify the aisle, middle and window rows and has clear seating plan and passenger number.
4.Testability, TDD and test cases

Software requirements:
 
since we are using java for coding ,needed jdk 
-check for latest version:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html
 
 NetBeans-platform to execute code.
 various verion available.
